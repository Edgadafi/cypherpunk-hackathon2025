## Script Breakdown

### [0:00 - 0:15] HOOK (15 seconds)

**[Visual: Show Polymarket/traditional betting site with odds]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Traditional prediction markets hide the truth. You don't know if the odds are manipulated. You can't verify if your payout is fair. You're betting blind."

**[Visual: Transition to PrismaFi logo/landing page]**

> "PrismaFi changes that. Every bet, every resolution, every payout - verified on-chain."

---

### [0:15 - 0:30] PROBLEM (15 seconds)

**[Visual: Split screen showing pain points]**

**Voiceover:**
> "The problem with prediction markets today? Three things:
> 
> First - Opacity. You're trusting a black box.
> 
> Second - High fees. Five to fifty dollars in Ethereum gas kills small bets.
> 
> Third - Centralized control. Markets can be censored or shut down anytime."

**[Visual: Show expensive Ethereum transaction, "Market Closed" message]**

> "This makes prediction markets inaccessible to most people."

---

### [0:30 - 0:60] SOLUTION (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Quick demo of PrismaFi interface]**

**Voiceover:**
> "PrismaFi is different. Built on Solana, we're making prediction markets transparent, fast, and accessible.
>
> Create any market in 30 seconds. Place bets for a fraction of a cent. See real-time odds update as bets come in.
>
> But here's what makes us unique: AI-powered market analysis."

**[Visual: Show AI Market Analyzer component]**

> "We've integrated Swarms multi-agent AI. Three specialized agents analyze sentiment, historical data, and strategy - giving you insights no other prediction market offers.
>
> The AI doesn't decide for you. It helps you make better decisions."

**[Visual: Show dashboard with stats, leaderboard, activity feed]**

> "Track your performance. See global rankings. Share your wins. Everything verifiable on-chain."

### [0:60 - 0:75] ARCHITECTURE (15 seconds)

**[Visual: Show architecture diagram]**

**Voiceover:**
> "The tech stack: Next.js frontend, Solana blockchain with Anchor smart contracts, and Swarms AI for multi-agent orchestration.
>
> Transactions settle in under one second. Fees are twenty-five hundredths of a cent. No intermediaries. No custody risk."

**[Visual: Show comparison table: PrismaFi vs competitors]**
