# 🎬 Trepa - Demo Guide & Talking Points

> Complete guide for presenting Trepa at the Cypherpunk Hackathon 2025

---

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"**Trepa** is a next-generation prediction market on Solana that lets you **bet on numbers, not just yes/no**. Instead of asking 'Will Bitcoin hit $100k?', we let you predict *where exactly* it will land. More accurate predictions earn bigger rewards. Think of it as **darts, not coin flips**."

---

## 📋 Demo Script (5 minutes)

### 1. Opening Hook (30s)

**"Show of hands - who here has used a prediction market like Polymarket?"**

*"Great! Now, have you ever felt frustrated that you can only bet yes or no? You *know* Bitcoin won't hit $100k, but you also think $85k is too high... What if you could bet it lands at $92k?"*

**"That's what Trepa does. Let me show you."**

---

### 2. Product Demo (3 min)

#### Part A: Browse Markets (30s)

**Action**: Navigate to `/markets` page

**Script**: 
*"Here's our live marketplace on Solana Devnet. Notice the **real-time updates** - this green indicator shows data refreshing every 10 seconds. You can search, filter by category, and see implied probabilities calculated from the betting pool."*

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- ✅ Real-time odds updating
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Category filters
- ✅ Visual status indicators

---

#### Part B: Place a Bet (45s)

**Action**: Click on a market, place a bet

**Script**:
*"Let's click into a market. Here you see the full details - question, resolution criteria, end date. The odds update in real-time as people bet. I'm going to bet 0.1 SOL on Yes."*

**[Connect Phantom wallet]**

*"I connect my Phantom wallet - this is all on Solana Devnet, so it's free test SOL. Confirm the transaction... and boom, my bet is placed. Notice how the odds immediately updated."*

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Wallet integration (Phantom)
- ✅ Instant transaction confirmation
- ✅ Live odds recalculation
- ✅ Transaction cost (<0.001 SOL)

---

#### Part C: User Dashboard (30s)

**Action**: Navigate to `/dashboard`

**Script**:
*"Now let me show you my personal dashboard. Here I can see all my active bets, my win rate, profit/loss, ROI - all updating in real-time every 8 seconds. I can filter by status, claim winnings, and see which markets I'm winning."*

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Personal stats tracking
- ✅ Win rate & ROI metrics
- ✅ Active/resolved bet filtering
- ✅ One-click claim winnings

---

#### Part D: Social Features (30s)

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Global rankings
- ✅ Public profiles
- ✅ Social sharing
- ✅ Activity feed

---

#### Part E: Resolution & Claiming (30s)

**Action**: Show resolved market and claim button

**Script**:
*"When a market ends, the creator resolves it with the winning outcome. Winners then claim their proportional share of the losing pool. It's all trustless on Solana - no centralized authority."*

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Market creator resolution
- ✅ Proportional payouts
- ✅ Trustless claiming
- ✅ On-chain verification

---

### 3. Technical Highlights (1 min)

**Script**:
*"Under the hood, Trepa is built with:*

### 4. The Vision (30s)

**Script**:
*"Right now, Trepa is binary markets - yes or no. But our roadmap includes **scalar markets** where you bet on continuous values. Imagine predicting Bitcoin's exact price, or GDP growth, or inflation numbers. The closer you are, the more you win."*

*"We're also planning:*
- *Automated oracle resolution with Chainlink/Pyth*
- *Liquidity pools and AMMs*
- *Mobile app*
- *Mainnet launch"*

---

### 5. Closing (30s)

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you ensure fair resolution?**

A: *"Currently, market creators resolve their own markets, similar to early Augur. We're implementing UMA's optimistic oracle pattern where anyone can dispute incorrect resolutions with a bond. Long-term, we'll integrate Chainlink/Pyth for automated resolution of price-based markets."*

---

**Q: What prevents creators from cheating?**

A: *"Great question! Right now, it's reputation-based - your profile is public, so bad actors get exposed. In our next version, we're adding a dispute mechanism where wrong resolutions can be challenged with economic incentives to be honest."*

---

**Q: Why Solana over Ethereum?**

A: *"Three reasons: speed, cost, and composability. Solana gives us sub-second finality and transaction costs under $0.001. For a betting app where users make frequent small bets, that's critical. Plus, Solana's programming model with Anchor makes it easy to build secure, auditable contracts."*

---

**Q: How is this different from Polymarket?**

A: *"Polymarket is amazing for binary markets, but limited to yes/no. Trepa's roadmap includes scalar markets where you bet on ranges and exact values. We're also fully open-source, while Polymarket is closed. And we're Solana-native, which means cheaper transactions."*

---

**Q: What's your business model?**

A: *"We're planning a small platform fee (1-2%) on winning bets, similar to how betting exchanges work. We're also exploring a governance token ($TREPA) for stakeholders who want to participate in platform decisions and earn fee revenue."*

---

**Q: How do you handle liquidity?**

A: *"Right now, it's a peer-to-pool model - all bets go into a single pool, and winners split the losers' contributions proportionally. It's simple and works for any market size. For v2, we're building an AMM (Automated Market Maker) to provide instant liquidity and tighter spreads."*

---

**Q: Can I use this on mainnet?**

A: *"Not yet - we're on Devnet for testing. Mainnet launch is planned after we've completed a smart contract audit and added dispute resolution. We expect Q2 2025 for mainnet beta."*

---

**Q: What about regulatory concerns?**

A: *"Prediction markets are legal in many jurisdictions when structured correctly. We're consulting with legal experts to ensure compliance. Some markets (like sports betting) may be restricted in certain regions, but information markets (like economic indicators) are generally allowed. Users are responsible for complying with their local laws."*

---

**Q: How do you plan to grow this?**

A: *"Three pillars:*
1. *Community - incentivize early market creators with rewards*
2. *Partnerships - integrate with data providers and other DeFi protocols*
3. *Content - create interesting markets around major events to drive engagement"*
