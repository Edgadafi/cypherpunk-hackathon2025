## 🌟 What Makes PrismaFi Different?

Traditional prediction markets suffer from opacity and trust issues. You never know if odds are manipulated or if your payout will arrive.

**PrismaFi changes the game:**
- 🔍 **Full Transparency**: Every bet, resolution, and payout is verifiable on-chain
- ⚡ **Instant Settlements**: Claims settle in <1 second with Solana's speed
- 💰 **Ultra-Low Fees**: $0.00025 per transaction vs $5-50 on Ethereum
- 🔗 **Permissionless**: Anyone can create markets without gatekeepers
- 🎨 **Beautiful UX**: Minimalist-brutalist design with real-time updates

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Devnet Only** - Not on mainnet yet (use test SOL)
- **SOL-Only Betting** - Currently supports only SOL for betting. Stablecoin support (USDC/USDT) planned for v2
