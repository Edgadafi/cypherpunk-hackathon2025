# 🗳️ Prediction Market LATAM

**Permisionless prediction markets for social accountability and transparency in Latin America**

## 🎯 Vision

Democratizing truth and accountability through decentralized prediction markets where citizens can bet on and validate information about social, political, and economic events in LATAM.

## 💡 The Problem

- **Corruption & Lack of Transparency**: Government promises often go unfulfilled
- **Data Manipulation**: Official information can be biased or misleading  
- **No Accountability**: Citizens have no skin in the game to validate claims
- **Centralized Truth**: Media and institutions control narratives

## 🚀 The Solution

A **Polymarket for LATAM** that enables:

### 🔍 **Decentralized Truth**
- Crowd-sourced validation with economic incentives
- Money-backed predictions are more honest than political promises
- On-chain evidence that can't be erased or manipulated

### ⚖️ **Social Accountability**
- Anyone can create markets about government promises
- "Will the bridge be finished by December 31st?"
- Real-time tracking of public project completion

### 🛡️ **Civic Tool**
- Instead of just complaining, citizens participate with skin in the game
- Verifiable, public results on blockchain
- Economic incentives to expose truth

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure Projects**
- "Will the Mexico City airport be completed on time?"
- "Will the Puebla bridge open before 2024 ends?"

### 🏛️ **Political Promises**
- "Will the minimum wage increase be implemented?"
- "Will corruption cases be prosecuted this year?"

### 🏥 **Social Programs**
- "Will vaccination targets be met?"
- "Will housing programs reach their goals?"

### ⚽ **Engagement Hooks**
- Sports predictions to attract users initially
- Local team performance markets
