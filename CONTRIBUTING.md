## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Use TypeScript types
interface Market {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  endTime: number;
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Use meaningful names
const fetchActiveMarkets = async () => { ... }

// ‚ùå Bad: Vague names
const getData = async () => { ... }

// ‚úÖ Good: Add comments for complex logic
// Calculate proportional winnings based on pool distribution
const winnings = (bet.amount / totalWinningBets) * totalLosingPool;

// ‚úÖ Good: Use const/let, not var
const market = await fetchMarket(id);
let counter = 0;

// ‚ùå Bad: Using var
var market = await fetchMarket(id);
```

### Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Format all files
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check
```

### Linting

We use ESLint for code quality:

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Rust/Anchor

```rust
// ‚úÖ Good: Use descriptive names
pub fn create_market(
    ctx: Context<CreateMarket>,
    question: String,
    end_time: i64,
) -> Result<()> { ... }

// ‚úÖ Good: Add validation
require!(
    question.len() >= 10 && question.len() <= 200,
    ErrorCode::InvalidQuestionLength
);

// ‚úÖ Good: Document public functions
/// Creates a new prediction market
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `question` - Market question (10-200 chars)
/// * `end_time` - Market end time (unix timestamp)
pub fn create_market(...) -> Result<()> { ... }

// ‚úÖ Good: Use proper error handling
let market = ctx.accounts.market.load_mut()?;
```

### Git Commits

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing

```typescript
// Unit tests (coming soon)
describe('calculateOdds', () => {
  it('should calculate correct implied probability', () => {
    const odds = calculateOdds(100, 50);
    expect(odds).toBe(66.67);
  });
});

// Integration tests
describe('Market Creation', () => {
  it('should create market successfully', async () => {
    const result = await createMarket({
      question: 'Test market?',
      endTime: Date.now() + 86400000,
    });
    expect(result).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Smart Contract Testing

```rust
// Anchor test example
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_create_market() {
    let market = create_test_market(&program).await;
    
    assert_eq!(market.question, "Test market?");
    assert_eq!(market.resolved, false);
    assert_eq!(market.total_yes_amount, 0);
}
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Market creation works

- [ ] Odds update correctly
- [ ] Dashboard shows correct stats
- [ ] Leaderboard rankings are accurate

## Documentation

### When to Update Docs

Update documentation if you:

- Add a new feature
- Change existing behavior
- Fix a bug that wasn't obvious
- Add new configuration options
- Change API/contract interface

### Documentation Locations

- **README.md** - Project overview, quick start
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical decisions, patterns
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Deployment instructions
- **DEMO.md** - Presentation guide
- **Code comments** - Complex logic inline

### Writing Good Docs

```markdown
# ‚úÖ Good: Clear, concise, with examples

## Creating a Market

To create a new prediction market:

1. Connect your wallet
2. Click "Create Market"
3. Fill in the form:
   - Question (10-200 chars)
   - Description (resolution criteria)
   - End date/time

Example:
\`\`\`typescript
const market = await createMarket({
  question: 'Will Bitcoin reach $100k in 2025?',
  description: 'Resolves Yes if BTC > $100k...',
  endTime: 1735689600,
});
\`\`\`

# ‚ùå Bad: Vague, no examples

## Markets

You can make markets. Just fill out the form.
